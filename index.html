  <h2>Exercise poem</h2>  
  
  

 <p>Exercise is easy, exercise is fun,

      Exercise is great for everyone,
      
    
      Run, jog, walk, run or skip,
      
      Make sure you do at least a little bit.
      
      Increase your exercise day by day,
      
      Keep at it and you will find a way,
      
      To be healthy, to be aware,
      
      Exercise keeps you healthy,
      
      Exercise takes care,
      
      Exercise brings benefits,
      
      Many benefits that are free,
      
      Remember with exercise,
      
      You can live long and carefree,
      
      Free of all ailments, free of cholesterol,
      
      Free from all aches and pains,
      
      Be healthy and stand tall,
      
      Get up from your couch,
      
      And switch off the TV,
      
      Put away your games and your PSP’s,
      
      Run out, play and celebrate,

      The benefits of exercise,

      To be healthy and safe,

      Exercise and be,


“A” OKAY
